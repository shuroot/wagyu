# ✨ Contributing to Wagyu (Open Source)

Hi. You’re here. That’s weird. But also kinda cool. :3

This is the open-source (aka sanitized & 1-commit-behind) version of **Wagyu**, our extremely cursed roleplay web app. If you’re thinking of helping out: THANKS! We can’t promise fame or fortune, but we *can* promise bugs and chaos.

## 🧷 Who runs this?
- **Shuroot**: Lead dev, frontend & backend mastermind, catboy in denial
- **aira**: UI goblin, backend chaos gremlin, possibly on the floor coding right now

## 🛠️ How to Contribute
dont.
1. **Fork the repo**
2. **Clone it**, make a branch, do your thing
3. Keep commits clean(ish) and write comments pls 🙏
4. If your PR breaks everything, we *might* accept it anyway (we're unhinged)
5. Open a Pull Request with:
   - A brief explanation
   - Any screenshots (optional)
   - why?

## 🤖 Guidelines

- Be respectful. Duh.
- No NSFW in the repo.
- Don’t leak anything from the private repo — yes, we’ll know.
- no intentional vulns. please.
- Keep the code readable! If we can’t vibe with it, it won’t get merged.
- Ask before implementing major features; we probably already broke it ourselves 💥

## 🎁 Wanna Support Us?

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

This repo will **never** have sensitive production info or security stuff.  
It's for learning, messing around, and making it better together.  
Also we’re very gay and probably crying while coding this. Please be kind.
