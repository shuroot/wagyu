# 🥩 Wagyu (Open Source Edition)

Welcome to the sanitized, de-fanged, mostly-harmless version of **Wagyu**, the chaotic purple-coded RP web app built by two disaster devs and a soft CM with heart problems.

> **NOTE:** This repo is *always* kept **1 commit/version behind** the official private codebase to protect live user features, experimental chaos tools, and... whatever Sydney is building when we're not looking.



## 🌀 What Even *Is* Wagyu?

**Wagyu** is a weird, semi-haunted RP platform with:
- 🎭 Tinder-style OC Matchmaking (yes, swipe left on a furry mage if you must)
- 🌊 Live story feeds and server chats
- 🧠 Chaotic glitchy UX that *somehow* works
- 💬 RP-as-your-OC chat options
- 🔒 No selling your soul (we read the TOS... kinda)

It’s not just “Mascot 2.0” — it’s something *else.*  
And it’s held together by hot glue, unpaid labor, and a dream.



## 🗃️ This Repo Includes:

- Core frontend & backend code (React, Supabase, Firebase)
- No secret sauce. No production keys. No blackmail vault.
- A great base to **fork**, **learn**, or **ragefix** when something breaks
- Cleaned for safety... kinda

You’re welcome to contribute! Just… y’know. Be aware:
- This is a sanitized version — some live features are missing
- We’re emotional creatures; please follow the vibe
- If you want to PR something, ***actually explain it***
- We have opinions on design. They will leak into your review.

Wanna help? Fork it, branch it, and PR with love 💖  
(Or chaos. That works too.)


## 💸 Donations & Domains

We run Wagyu for free. But hosting, Supabase, Firebase, and Vercel... they ain’t free.  
Also we want to buy:
- **wagyu.app** & **wagyu.dev** (to replace our nasty `.vercel.app`)
- More Firebase project slots (we're at like... 4)
- Actual Vercel Pro (pls... no more throttling...)
- We use **pre-paid cards** and **Solana (SOL)** for donations because we like ✨privacy✨ and can’t KYC without selling our identities to the Void.

[🌐 Our donation site](https://wagyu.vercel.app/donate) has the spicy details and perks. It's a vibe.

## 💌 Final Thoughts

We don’t expect stars, forks, or hype.  
But if you found this and smiled... that’s enough.

Wagyu is weird. We are weird. Come be weird with us.
